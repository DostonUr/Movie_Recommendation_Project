This project is a personalized Movie Recommendation System built using Python and machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset of 10,000 movies and applies a content-based filtering approach, extracting features from genres, language, and descriptions. The model uses CountVectorizer for text processing and cosine similarity to calculate and recommend related movies. Key deliverables include Python code, a functional recommendation system, and comprehensive documentation. This system demonstrates expertise in NLP, data preprocessing, and machine learning for real-world applications.
